                        <p>
                            Project was made as a part of my summer internship in Xamk Game Studios.
                            I was our teams producer and it was my responsibility to make sure that the game was completed on time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            OiOi wall that we used and where the game was developed are in 
                            South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences Kouvola campus.
                            Wall is about 2.5 meter wide and 2 meter high.
                            The OiOi wall uses infrared system to notice movement on the area thats about 10 cm of the wall
                            itself.

                            Game itself is a puzzle game where players cut ropes to get the food to spider.
                            Every level is different and there is multiple ways on how to get the food to spider.
                            There is a cut limitation that varies on the levels. Some levels needs more cuts than others.
                        </p>

                            <b>My role</b> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I did a lot of time management and prioritizing work tasks and what assets we needed.
                            I attended start and end of week meetings and weekly producer meetings. 
                            In the meetings I told others how is our project doing, do we have problems and what have we done in past week and what is comming next.
                            We also had about 5 different pitches during the summer. 
                            I did the pitch decks and also presented them.

                            We made a lot of testing in the early part off the project because we didn't have any info of the OiOi wall and the MAC computer running the softwares.
                            Also none of us had experience of developing to OiOi wall.
                            So that lead to many tests that included stress tests, visual test and accuracy tests.

                        <p>
                            We made a physics based box generator.
                            Which only functionality was to add and remove box.
                            Purpose was to add as many boxes as we can to crash the computer.
                            After multiple tests we had a vision on how much the MAC can handle.

                        <p>
                            With the results of the test we changed the plan of the game.

                            We made a button tester with 10 different button sizes and locations.
                            With this test we saw which size and what height was perfect with the game buttons.

                            We made a test level of the game to see how thin ropes we need and how far away they had to be to each other.
